# HireSense

**AI-Powered Resume Intelligence & Career Path Recommendation System**

HireSense is a semantic AI-driven resume analysis platform that goes beyond traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Instead of relying on keyword matching, HireSense uses transformer-based language models to deeply understand resumes — extracting skills, technologies, and project experience while generating personalised learning and career transition paths.

Built for campus placement drives, HR teams, and working professionals, HireSense enables smarter hiring, skill gap analysis, and long-term career development.

## RBAC & Sessions

Three roles: **admin**, **manager**, **employee**.

- `admin` is created automatically on first startup. Cannot register via UI.
- `manager` and `employee` register via `/auth/register`.
- Any user with any role can log in on any port.
- Sessions are isolated per port using separate cookies:

| Port | URL                   | Session Cookie    |
|------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 5010 | http://localhost:5010 | `hs_session_5010` |
| 5011 | http://localhost:5011 | `hs_session_5011` |
| 5012 | http://localhost:5012 | `hs_session_5012` |

Logging in on port 5010 does not affect sessions on 5011 or 5012.

### Manager Features

Managers can:
- Create and manage projects with skill requirements
- View project skill dependencies
- Match employees to projects based on skill analysis
- Assign/unassign employees to projects
- Monitor employee skill and resume updates
- Verify employee skills
- Access self-service career development (learning paths, role comparison)

See [docs/MANAGER_FEATURES.md](docs/MANAGER_FEATURES.md) for details.

### Employee Features

Employees can:
- View assigned projects and requirements
- Upload and manage resumes
- Add, update, and remove skills
- Compare current profile with target roles
- Generate personalized learning paths
- Track career development progress

See [docs/EMPLOYEE_FEATURES.md](docs/EMPLOYEE_FEATURES.md) for details.

## Frontend Styling

All templates extend `app/templates/base.html`, which loads Tailwind CSS directly in the browser via the official CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>
```

A `<style type="text/tailwindcss">` block inside `base.html` holds any project-wide theme configuration (custom fonts, colours, etc.). No Node.js, no build step, and no compiled CSS files are required — edit a template and refresh the browser.

> **Note:** The browser CDN is optimised for development. When the project moves toward production, replace it with the Tailwind CLI build step to ship a minimised CSS bundle.

## First-Time Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker Desktop with Compose v2
- Git

---

### Option A — Docker (recommended)

**1. Clone and enter the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paarthsiloiya/HireSense.git
cd HireSense
```

**2. Create your environment file**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `SECRET_KEY` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` before any non-local deployment.

**3. Build and start all services**

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts PostgreSQL 15 on host port `5434` (container port `5432`) and three Flask instances on ports `5010`, `5011`, `5012`. The admin user is created automatically on first boot — no manual seeding required.

**4. Open a portal and log in**

| Port | URL                   |
|------|-----------------------|
| 5010 | http://localhost:5010 |
| 5011 | http://localhost:5011 |
| 5012 | http://localhost:5012 |

Username: `admin` — Password: value of `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (default: `Admin@1234`).

**5. Common Docker commands**

```bash
# Stop (data kept)
docker compose down

# Stop and delete all data
docker compose down -v

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose up --build

# Tail logs for one service
docker compose logs -f app_5010
```

---

### Option B — Docker Dev Mode (live reload)

Use this while actively developing. Your local source tree is mounted into the containers so template and Python changes are reflected immediately — no rebuild needed.

**1. Start all services with the dev override**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

First time, or after changing `requirements.txt`, add `--build`:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
```

**2. See your changes**

| Change type | What to do |
|-------------|------------|
| HTML / Tailwind classes | Refresh the browser |
| Python (`.py`) files | Flask debug server auto-restarts — refresh after a moment |
| `requirements.txt` | Restart with `--build` |

**3. Stop**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

---

### Option C — Local Virtual Environment

**1. Clone and enter the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paarthsiloiya/HireSense.git
cd HireSense
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Set up environment variables**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DATABASE_URL to your local PostgreSQL connection string
```

**5. Start a portal**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
PORT=5010 python run.py
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:PORT=5010; python run.py
```

Tables are created and the admin user is seeded automatically on first run. Register manager or employee accounts at `/auth/register`.

## Utility Scripts

HireSense includes utility scripts for development and testing in the `utility/` folder.

### Seeding Test Users

Generate fake users for testing:

```bash
# Default: Seed 30 approved users with mixed roles
flask seed-users

# Seed a specific number
flask seed-users 50

# Seed pending (unapproved) users
flask seed-users --pending

# Seed only managers or employees
flask seed-users --role=manager
flask seed-users --role=employee
```

All seeded users have the password: `password123`

**Docker usage:**

```bash
docker compose exec app_5010 flask seed-users
```

For more details, see [docs/UTILITY.md](docs/UTILITY.md).

### Seeding Test Data

Seed departments, skills, and sample projects:

```bash
# Basic seed (departments, skills, projects)
flask seed-data

# Full seed (includes user skills and assignments)
flask seed-data --full
```

**Docker usage:**

```bash
docker compose exec app_5010 flask seed-data --full
```

---

## Default Admin Credentials

| Username | Password     |
|----------|--------------|
| `admin`  | `Admin@1234` |

Change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` before any non-local deployment.
